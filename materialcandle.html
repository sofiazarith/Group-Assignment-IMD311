<br> Bonjour! Discover our new product Aromatherapy Candles [Candle Lab] for gifts and extra hampers for loved ones.<br>

<p><br>Material</br></p>

<br> Palm Wax, a natural material from palm fruit that is processed so that it can be used for cooking, cosmetics and other mixed needs.<br>
<br> Palm Wax is also biodegradable which means it can be decomposed naturally with a relatively faster time.<br>
<br> The aroma produced by the candle from Palm Wax, emits a more subtle aroma and is not too pungent.<br>
    
<br>Candles that use Palm wax base materials are also more durable than other materials.<br>

<p>  1 x Candle Lab 60gr</p>

<p>  1 x Box [without gift paper]</p>
    
<p>

<p>   Care instructions</p>
<p> - Do not light the candle for more than 1 hour because it will damage the components of the candle</p>
