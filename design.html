</p> <i>Because the shape is so distinctive and sets our candle design apart from others, we decided to go with a round logo for our candle design.<br> 
 Additionally, the circle chain of rose flowers in our candle lab logo represents the seven fragrance flavors we will be releasing for lab candles,
<br> including kenanga smell, rose rose, night whore scent, and many more. 
<br> Because our company's candles are unique and meant for everyone, the candle design logo also signifies our own creation.</p>
